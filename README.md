### Alternating layouts

This python script is taken from [olemartinorg](https://github.com/olemartinorg/i3-alternating-layout). All credit goes to him, this script is extremely useful for making tiling windows behave nicer within i3 window manager and I highly reccomend trying it out if you use i3 or sway.
